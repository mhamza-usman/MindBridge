# FROZEN.md

**Frozen on:** 2026-05-28
**Forked from:** `CopilotKit/CopilotKit@upstream/main` (commit `23af69041`), path `examples/integrations/langgraph-python`
**Verifier:** `pnpm verify-pins`

This is the canonical source of truth for what version of every load-bearing
dependency this starter runs against. CI re-runs the model-ID probe nightly so
a Google or upstream change is caught before event day.

> **Do not bump these.** AI assistants are explicitly forbidden from changing
> `@copilotkit/*` versions in `AGENTS.md`. The pre-commit hook rejects drift.

## LLM provider

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Provider | Google Gemini |
| SDK | `langchain-google-genai==4.2.4` (native Google Gen AI) |
| Model ID | **`gemini-3.5-flash`** |
| Env var | `GEMINI_API_KEY` |
| Free-tier key | https://aistudio.google.com/apikey |
| Verified | 2026-05-28 — UI→agent→Gemini with flat-shape frontend tools, `search_flights` fired, `createSurface` envelope returned |
| Multi-turn | Yes — native SDK handles `thought_signature` replay correctly across tool turns |

### Why this default

`gemini-3.5-flash` is the current Google Flash model (released 2026-05-19) —
beats 3.1 Pro on agentic benchmarks at Flash pricing, 1M context, 4× speed.

1. **Agentic-tuned.** Google positions Gemini Flash as the agentic flagship.
2. **Sponsor alignment.** Google is the venue + platform sponsor.
3. **Free tier.** No credit card required.
4. **Multi-turn safe** with `langchain-google-genai`'s native SDK (handles
   `thought_signature` replay; see history below).
5. **Tool shape clean.** Native SDK converts frontend-tool flat-shape entries
   correctly, no shim required (though `NormalizeToolShapeMiddleware`
   stays in place as belt-and-suspenders for future client swaps).

### History: how we landed on the native SDK

The base starter used `langchain-openai` against Gemini's OpenAI-compatibility
endpoint. Two issues surfaced through running the actual UI:

1. **`gemini-3.5-flash` 400s on multi-turn tool calls via OpenAI-compat:**

   ```
   Function call is missing a thought_signature in functionCall parts.
   This is required for tools to work correctly … Please refer to
   https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/thought-signatures
   ```

   `langchain-openai 1.1.9` strips Gemini's thought-metadata. `reasoning_effort:
   "none"` does not disable the requirement. We confirmed this twice (initial
   probe + re-probe on 2026-05-28).

2. **Frontend tool shape mismatch:** CopilotKit V2's `useFrontendTool()`
   registers tools with a flat `{name, description, parameters}` shape that
   Gemini's OpenAI-compat parser strict-rejects. OpenAI tolerates it; Gemini
   does not. We fixed this with `agent/src/middleware/normalize_tools.py`
   (see commit `7c58287`).

Switching the primary and secondary LLM to `langchain-google-genai` (the native
Google Gen AI SDK, `ChatGoogleGenerativeAI`) resolves (1) entirely and gives
us cleaner handling of (2) as a side-effect.

### Alternative — fall back to OpenAI-compat + `gemini-2.5-flash`

The OpenAI-compat code path stayed working with `gemini-2.5-flash`. If
`langchain-google-genai` ever breaks in a way that's worse than the OpenAI-
compat trap, swap back to:

```python
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
model = ChatOpenAI(
    model="gemini-2.5-flash",
    api_key=os.getenv("GEMINI_API_KEY"),
    base_url="https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/openai/",
    model_kwargs={"parallel_tool_calls": False},
)
```

This was the default from 2026-05-28 morning through ~22:50 UTC. The
`NormalizeToolShapeMiddleware` is required on this path; keep it.

### Models that 404'd in the probe (do not use)

- `gemini-3.0-flash`
- `gemini-2.5-flash-latest`
- `gemini-2.0-flash`, `gemini-2.0-flash-001`
- `gemini-1.5-flash`, `gemini-1.5-flash-latest`

### Free-tier rate-limit behavior

Measured 2026-05-28 against `gemini-2.5-flash` via the OpenAI-compat endpoint
with a single API key. Tool see `scripts/load-test-gemini.py`.

| Concurrency | Successes | Failures | p50 (ms) | p95 (ms) | p99 (ms) | Wall (ms) | Retry-After |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 30 | 30 / 30 | 0 | 1707 | 2027 | 2104 | 2315 | none |
| 100 | 100 / 100 | 0 | 1883 | 2314 | 2817 | 2973 | none |

Single-key cliff is well above 100 concurrent agentic tool-calling requests.
At London-hackathon scale (~30 teams × per-team API keys + a small mentor
fallback pool), this is comfortable headroom. Three rate-limit mitigations
(per-team keys via prereq email, mentor fallback pool, `OFFLINE=1` insurance)
are sufficient; we do NOT need to ship a shared key.

> **2026-05-29: bumped to 1.57.4 for the pdf-analyst demo (owner sign-off;

> `@copilotkit/react-ui`, `@ag-ui/client`, `@ag-ui/core`, `pdfjs-dist`, and
> `recharts` were added. A Phase-0 spike confirmed forced `tool_choice` still

> **pdf-analyst is now the default demo (was an example).** It used to live

## Pinned versions (Python)

| Package | Pin | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `langchain` | `1.3.1` | Re-pinned exact 2026-06-04 (was `1.2.15`). Floated up when pdf-analyst's agent `pyproject.toml` (which used `>=` floors) was adopted as the root agent in Phase 2; re-pinned to the resolved version with owner sign-off. |
| `langchain-core` | `1.4.0` | Pinned exact 2026-06-04 alongside the `langchain`/`langgraph` re-pin. |
| `langgraph` | `1.2.1` | Re-pinned exact 2026-06-04 (was `1.1.6`); see the `langchain` note. |
| `langgraph-cli[inmem]` | `0.4.21` | Only used by the archived PortKit agent (`other-examples/portkit/`). The default agent now serves over FastAPI — see "Serving" below. |
| `langchain-openai` | `1.1.9` | Drives the OpenAI swap path and the documented Gemini OpenAI-compat fallback |
| `langchain-anthropic` | `1.4.1` | For the Anthropic swap matrix |
| `copilotkit` | `>=0.1.90` | Python SDK; floor raised 2026-05-29 for the pdf-analyst default demo |
| `ag-ui-langgraph` | `>=0.0.36` | AG-UI ↔ LangGraph bridge; powers the FastAPI endpoints (`add_langgraph_fastapi_endpoint`) for the pdf-analyst default demo |
| `uvicorn` | (via FastAPI) | ASGI server the default agent runs under (`uvicorn main:app --port 8123`) |
| `openai` | `1.109.1` | Transitive (used by langchain-openai) |

`agent/uv.lock` is committed and authoritative. `pnpm verify-pins` asserts the
`langchain` / `langchain-core` / `langgraph` versions above against it (not
just the JS pins).

## Serving

The default agent (`agent/main.py`) is a **FastAPI app** run with
`uvicorn main:app --port 8123` (`pnpm dev:agent` → `scripts/run-agent.sh`).
It mounts three AG-UI ↔ LangGraph endpoints — `/fixed`, `/dynamic`, `/legal`
— via `ag_ui_langgraph.add_langgraph_fastapi_endpoint`. The Docker/prod path
is this same native FastAPI app.

The old **langgraph-cli** serving path (`langgraph dev` / `langgraph.json` /
the `serve.py` AG-UI wrapper) belonged to the PortKit default and now
applies only to the archived demo under `other-examples/portkit/` (which
ships its own `agent/langgraph.json`). There is no `serve.py` at the repo
root anymore — it was retired during the pdf-analyst promotion and is not
on the pdf-analyst serving path.

## Package manager

| Layer | Manager | Lockfile |
|---|---|---|
| JavaScript | pnpm | `pnpm-lock.yaml` (committed) — a **single root lockfile** after the pdf-analyst merge |
| Python | uv | `agent/uv.lock` (committed) |

The archived PortKit demo carries its own `other-examples/portkit/agent/uv.lock`
for standalone use, but it is not installed by the root project.

## Vendoring

`vendor/` mirrors the two load-bearing CopilotKit packages as break-glass
insurance if upstream yanks or breaks a pinned release before event day:

| Package | Vendored as | Version |
|---|---|---|
| `@copilotkit/a2ui-renderer` | `vendor/copilotkit-a2ui-renderer/` (extracted) | `1.57.4` |
| `copilotkit` (Python) | `vendor/copilotkit-python/copilotkit-0.1.93-py3-none-any.whl` | `0.1.93` |

Both match the pins above. Note: the `copilotkit` `0.1.9x` line is already
yanked from public PyPI, so the vendored wheel is the retained copy — install
relies on the exact pin in `agent/uv.lock`. CI proves the vendored swap builds;
swap + refresh procedure in `vendor/README.md`.
