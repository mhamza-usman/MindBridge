"""For each fixture: every {path: "..."} reference resolves against the data.

This gate catches the path-vs-data-shape class of bug where a Python
_build_data emits, say, ``{"projects": [...]}`` but the catalog JSON binds
``{path: "projectList"}``. The renderer silently shows nothing; the bug is
only visible at runtime.

Walks the component tree carrying a data scope:
- Bare ``{"path": "foo"}`` resolves against the current scope.
- Template binding ``{"componentId": "X", "path": "/foo"}`` mounts an array
  at ``foo`` and any descendants of component ``X`` resolve against an
  *item* of that array (we probe the first element).
- Child string references (``"children": ["card-id", ...]``) look the
  referenced component up by id and inherit the current scope.
